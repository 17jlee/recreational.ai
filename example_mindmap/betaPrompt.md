Each prompt is given in the form of [text, person who said text]. The text is to be summarised and then made into a node for a mind-map. Every time a new prompt is given with a new text, the AI should re-evaluate everything that it currently has in the mind map and make the mind map as concise as possible by removing multiple nodes if necessary and replacing it with one new node. Nodes can be linked together and should be if they are related. Each node can only be related to one node.
